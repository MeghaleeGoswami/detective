# YouTube Copyright Detector 🔍

A crowdsourced copyright detection system that learns from user-submitted reference videos to identify potentially copyrighted content in new uploads.

## 🌟 Features

- **Crowdsourced Learning**: Users submit reference videos to build a pattern database
- **Multi-Modal Analysis**: Detects suspicious patterns in audio, visual, and metadata
- **Pattern-Based Detection**: Learns characteristics rather than storing copyrighted content
- **Risk Assessment**: Provides low/medium/high risk ratings with confidence scores
- **Detailed Reports**: Generates downloadable analysis reports
- **Real-time Analysis**: Live progress tracking during video processing

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Database Curation**
- Users upload videos they suspect contain copyrighted content
- System extracts patterns: audio quality markers, visual characteristics, metadata keywords
- Builds a growing database of suspicious patterns (not the content itself)

### 2. **Copyright Detection**
- Upload a video to analyze
- System compares against learned patterns from reference database
- Identifies potential matches with confidence scores and timestamps
- Provides actionable recommendations

### 3. **Legal & Ethical Approach**
- No copyrighted content is stored - only learned patterns
- Community-driven database improves over time
- Respects fair use and copyright law

2. **Computer Vision**: Add actual visual pattern recognition
3. **Machine Learning**: Implement ML models for better accuracy
4. **Database Integration**: Connect to persistent storage
5. **API Integration**: Use services like ACRCloud for audio recognition

## 🎨 UI Components

### Main Interface
- **Tab Navigation**: Switch between curation and detection modes
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop video upload with validation
- **Video Preview**: Built-in video player for uploaded content
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time analysis progress with stage descriptions

### Results Display
- **Risk Level Cards**: Color-coded risk assessment (low/medium/high)
- **Issue Details**: Specific pattern matches with confidence scores
- **Pattern Attribution**: Shows which reference videos contributed to detection
- **Action Buttons**: Download reports, analyze new videos
